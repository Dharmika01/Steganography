# 🕵️‍♂️ **Steganography Tool** - Hide Secret Messages Inside Images

**Steganography** is the art of hiding messages within ordinary, everyday files. With this Python-based tool, you can securely encode and decode secret messages within images, ensuring your private information stays hidden in plain sight!

---

## 🚀 **Key Features**
- **Hide & Seek**: Safely encode secret messages into image files using Least Significant Bit (LSB) steganography.
- **Easy-to-Use Interface**: A simple **Tkinter GUI** allows users to encode and decode messages effortlessly.
- **No Visible Changes**: The image remains unchanged to the naked eye, while your secret message stays hidden in its pixels.
- **Instant Results**: Real-time encoding and decoding for efficient message retrieval.

---

## 🛠 **Technologies Used**
- **Python**: The main programming language powering the tool.
- **Tkinter**: For building the user-friendly interface.
- **Pillow**: Handles image processing for encoding and decoding messages.
- **Bitarray**: Converts text into binary, which is essential for encoding messages in the image.

## 🏁 **How to Run**

### Requirements:
- Python 3.x
- Tkinter (pre-installed with Python)
- Pillow: `pip install pillow`
- Bitarray: `pip install bitarray`

### Steps:
1. Clone the repository:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Dharmika01/Steganography-Tool.git
   ```
2. Install dependencies:  
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Run the tool:  
   ```bash
   python steganography_tool.py
   ```

4. Use the **GUI** to:
